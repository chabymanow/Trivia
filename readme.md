# Trivia program
---
It is a **Trivia** game like program but it is not an actual game because it write out the question and the answer as well.

The program gets the questions and the answers from the api-ninja website

[https://api-ninjas.com/](https://www.example.com)

You need to register an API key to use it. This is free to use.

This version of the program uses **QT5**
window, so you need to install and have the **PyQT5 GUI** toolkit. But feel free to modify this program for **terminal** or **Tkinter**
